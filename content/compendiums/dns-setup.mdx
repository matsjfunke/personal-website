## Understanding DNS

DNS (Domain Name System) is the internet's phone book.

- It translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the network.

## DNS Record Types Explained

- **A Record:** Maps a domain to an IPv4 address, telling browsers where to find your website.

- **AAAA Record:** Similar to an A record, but maps a domain to an IPv6 address for next-generation Internet Protocol.

- **CNAME Record:** Creates an alias by pointing one domain or subdomain to another domain name.

- **MX Record:** Specifies the mail servers responsible for handling email for your domain.

- **NS Record:** Identifies the authoritative name servers for your domain.

- **SOA Record:** Contains administrative information about your DNS zone, including serial number and refresh intervals.

- **TXT Record:** Holds text information for various purposes, often used for domain verification or SPF records.

- **PTR Record:** Used for reverse DNS lookups, mapping an IP address to a domain name.

- **SRV Record:** Specifies the location of specific services, like VoIP or instant messaging.

- **CAA Record:** Specifies which Certificate Authorities are allowed to issue SSL/TLS certificates for your domain.

## Configuring DNS Records

### Step 1: Access Your Domain Registrar's DNS Management

Log in to your domain registrar's website and navigate to the DNS management section.

### Step 2: Add an A Record

### DNS Records

1. **Root Domain (A Record)**

   - Type: A
   - Host: @
   - Value: Your.Server.IP.Address
   - TTL: 3600

2. **WWW Subdomain (A Record)**

   - Type: A
   - Host: www
   - Value: Your.Server.IP.Address
   - TTL: 3600

3. **API Subdomain (A Record)**
   - Type: A
   - Host: api
   - Value: Your.Server.IP.Address:BackendPort
   - TTL: 3600

**Notes:**

- Replace `Your.Server.IP.Address` with your actual server IP address.
- The `BackendPort` in the API record should be replaced with the actual port your API is running on (e.g., 3000, 8080, etc.).
- TTL (Time To Live) is set to 3600 seconds (1 hour) in this example. You may adjust this based on your needs.
- Access domain in browser

## Verifying DNS Configuration

### Use dig Command

```sh
dig yourdomain.com
```

- Use online tools like Domain Digger or DNSChecker to verify your DNS configuration from multiple locations.

**Note**: DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to propagate globally, although they often take effect much sooner.
