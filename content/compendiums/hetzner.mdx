## Introduction

This is a comprehensive guide to setting up a Virtual Private Server (VPS) on Hetzner Cloud.
Simply follow the steps from start to finish to ensure a smooth setup process.
It covers everything from creating a server, setting up SSH access, configuring firewalls, managing users, and transferring files.
By the end of this guide, you will have a fully operational VPS tailored to your project's needs.

## Go to hetzner cloud

- add server
- select server components:
  - Location
  - Operating system
  - CPU cores & type
  - RAM
  - Storage

## Setup SSH

#### 1. generate ssh-key in you terminal

```sh
cd ~/.ssh

ssh-keygen -t ed25519

Enter file in which to save the key (/path/to/your/.ssh/id_ed25519): <project-name>

Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): <CR> or enter any passphrase
```

#### 2. add pbulic key to hetzner

copy the public key and paste into field hetzner console

```sh
cat ~/.ssh/project-name.pub
```

#### 3. give permission to read privatekey-file

```sh
chmod 400 ~/.ssh/<project-name>
```

### Add firewall on Hetzner dashboard

**1. Click "Add Rule" ("Regel hinzufügen") and create the following rules:**

#### SSH Access

- Source IP: Any IPv4, Any IPv6
- Protocol: TCP
- Port: 22

#### HTTP Access

- Source IP: Any IPv4, Any IPv6
- Protocol: TCP
- Port: 80

#### HTTPS Access

- Source IP: Any IPv4, Any IPv6
- Protocol: TCP
- Port: 443

**2. Verify that:**

- All rules show as active
- Status shows "Vollständig angewendet" (Fully applied)
- Rules are applied to the selected resource ("Angewendet auf 1 Ressource")

### Name server

choose a descriptive name fitting your project

## Connenct to server via ssh

- copy server IPv4 address from hetzner server dashboard

```sh
ssh -i ~/.ssh/<project-name> root@<IPv4>
```

### Update and upgrade system packages after first login

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo reboot
```

than ssh back into the server

## User Management

#### 1. Create a non-root user with sudo privileges

```sh
adduser <username>

usermod -aG sudo <username>
```

#### 2. Copy SSH key for new user

```sh
mkdir -p /home/<username>/.ssh
cp ~/.ssh/authorized_keys /home/<username>/.ssh/
chown -R <username>:<username> /home/<username>/.ssh
chmod 700 /home/<username>/.ssh
chmod 600 /home/<username>/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

#### 3. Test sudo access with the new user:

```sh
su - <username>
# with new user run
sudo whoami  # Should return "root"
```

#### 4. After confirming everything works, you should update the SSH configuration to disable root login:

```sh
sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Change or add these lines:

```sh
PermitRootLogin no
PasswordAuthentication no
PubkeyAuthentication yes
```

#### 5. Restart the SSH service:

```sh
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

#### 6. Test new SSH connection in a new terminal window before logging out:

```sh
ssh -i ~/.ssh/<project-name> <username>@<IPv4>
```

## File transfer / management setup

either git or rsync

#### 1. git

```sh
sudo apt install git -y
# now generate an access token on github, done
git clone https://<token>@github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
git pull https://<token>@github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
```

#### 2. rsync

```sh
sudo apt install rsync -y
```

Use rsync on your maschine to send to server

```sh
rsync -avz /source/directory/ <username>@<IPv4>:directory/
```
