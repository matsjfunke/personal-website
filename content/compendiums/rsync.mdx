### Introduction

This guide covers `rsync`, a fast and versatile command-line utility for synchronizing files / directories between two locations over a network.
You'll learn the basics of rsync, understand it's process, and practical usage scenarios such as data synchronization (transfer & deletion), excluding data during operations, bandwidth limiting and looging setup.

### Rsync Basics

- **Source:** The location of the files or directories you want to copy (e.g. local path or a remote server).
- **Destination:** The location where you want to copy the files or directories to (e.g. local path or a remote server).
- **Options:** `rsync` provides various options to customize the synchronization process, such as preserving file permissions, compressing data, and excluding files.

### Rsync Process

1. **Initiate Connection:**

   - `rsync` can operate over SSH to securely transfer data. The connection is established using SSH credentials if specified.

2. **File Comparison:**

   - `rsync` compares files between the source and destination, determining which files need to be transferred based on differences in size, modification time, or checksum.

3. **Data Transfer:**

   - Only the differences between files are transferred, minimizing bandwidth usage. This is achieved through a process called delta encoding.

### Rsync Usage

#### 1. Basic file synchronization

```sh
rsync -avz /path/to/source/ /path/to/destination/
```

- `-a`: Archive mode, preserves permissions, timestamps, and other attributes.
- `-v`: Verbose output, shows the progress of the transfer.
- `-z`: Compresses data during transfer for efficiency.

#### 2. Synchronize with a remote server

```sh
rsync -avz -e ssh /path/to/source/ user@remote:/path/to/destination/
```

- `-e ssh`: Specifies SSH as the remote shell for secure data transfer.

#### 3. Exclude specific files or directories

**Option 1:**

```sh
rsync -avz --exclude='*.tmp' /path/to/source/ /path/to/destination/
```

- `--exclude='*.tmp'`: Excludes all files with the `.tmp` extension from the transfer.

**Option 1:**
exclude specific files or directories using a list with `.rsyncignore` which works similar to `.gitignore`.

First, create a file named `.rsyncignore` (or any name you prefer) and add the patterns of files or directories you want to exclude. Each pattern should be on a separate line. For example:

```
venv/
node_modules/
*.log
```

Use the `--exclude-from` option with `rsync` to specify this file:

```sh
rsync -avz --exclude-from='.rsyncignore' /path/to/source/ /path/to/destination/
```

- `--exclude-from='.rsyncignore'`: This tells `rsync` to read the exclusion patterns from the specified file `.rsyncignore`. This is useful for managing multiple exclusions without cluttering the command line.

#### 4. Delete files in the destination that are not present in the source

```sh
rsync -avz --delete /path/to/source/ /path/to/destination/
```

- `--delete`: Removes files from the destination that are not present in the source.

#### 5. Dry run to preview changes

```sh
rsync -avz --dry-run /path/to/source/ /path/to/destination/
```

- `--dry-run`: Simulates the synchronization process without making any changes, useful for verifying what will be transferred.

#### 6. Limit bandwidth usage

```sh
rsync -avz --bwlimit=5000 /path/to/source/ /path/to/destination/
```

- `--bwlimit=5000`: Limits the transfer speed to 5000 KB/s.

#### 7. Logging transfer details

```sh
rsync -avz --log-file=/path/to/logfile.log /path/to/source/ /path/to/destination/
```

- `--log-file=/path/to/logfile.log`: Records the details of the transfer to a specified log file.
