## What is MCP?

Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to
connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to
connect AI models to different data sources and tools.

## Why should you care?

1. The MCP specification was originally proposed by Anthropic but OpenAI and Google have also adopted it.
   Making it the industry standard for for Model Prodivers.

2. Big Techs like Attlassian, Cloudflare, Github, and others are adopting MCP and exposing their APIs as MCP servers.

3. More and more companies want to prevent vendor lock-in and reduce complexity in building and maintaining non-standard integrations

## How does it work? (A technical deep dive)

To those familiar with HTTP and APIs, MCP is a simple HTTP request and response protocol. But instead of using JSON
over HTTP, MCP uses JSON-RPC.

### The MCP server

The server exposes **tools** (think post requests), **resources** (think get requests) and **prompts** (templates of how to interact with the server).

#### 1. Data Layer: JSON-RPC (Remote Procedure Call)

JSON-RPC provides consistent message structure and three message types:

- **Requests** with IDs that expect responses
- **Responses** that match request IDs
- **Notifications** for one-way communication without responses

> As the name Remote Procedure Call suggests, it enables to ask another computer to run a function (procedure) and get the result, as if you were running it locally.

To an LLM engineers familiar with tool calling, the structure of a JSON-RPC message may be familiar.
Tools are essentially functions that the LLM can "call" remotely, using a JSON-RPC-like protocol to specify the function name, parameters.

Example web search tool call:

```json
{
  "tool": "web_search",
  "parameters": {
    "query": "latest AI developments"
  }
}
```

#### 2. MCP protocol methods (most methods are optional):

| Method                   | Purpose                         | Returns                                |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| ping                     | Check if server is responsive   | Empty result object                    |
| initialize               | Get server capabilities         | Server capabilities and info           |
| tools/list               | Discover available tools        | Array of tool definitions with schemas |
| tools/call               | Execute a specific tool         | Tool execution result                  |
| resources/list           | List available direct resources | Array of resource descriptors          |
| resources/read           | Retrieve resource contents      | Resource data with metadata            |
| resources/templates/list | Discover resource templates     | Array of resource template definitions |
| resources/subscribe      | Monitor resource changes        | Subscription confirmation              |

here is a simple Python fastapi example in JSON-RPC format:

```python
# mcp.py
import uvicorn
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/mcp")
async def json_rpc(request: Request):
    body = await request.json()
    method = body.get("method")
    params = body.get("params")
    id_ = body.get("id")

    if method == "tools/list":
        return {
            "jsonrpc": "2.0",
            "result": {
                "tools": [
                    {
                        "name": "add_numbers",
                        "description": "Adds two numbers",
                        "inputSchema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"a": {"type": "number"}, "b": {"type": "number"}}, "required": ["a", "b"]},
                    }
                ]
            },
            "id": id_,
        }

    if method == "tools/call":
        a = params["arguments"]["a"]
        b = params["arguments"]["b"]
        return {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "result": {"sum": a + b}, "id": id_}

    return {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "error": {"code": -32601, "message": "Method not found"}, "id": id_}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8080)
    # pip install fastapi uvicorn
    # python mcp.py
```

You can test this server from your terminal using `curl`.

To list the available tools:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/mcp \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "tools/list",
  "id": 1
}'
```

To call the `add_numbers` tool:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/mcp \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "arguments": { "a": 5, "b": 3 }
  },
  "id": 2
}'
```

#### 3. Transport Layer

Now that we know what format / purpose the data has we we need to transfer it.
The MCP protocol supports multiple transport layers:

Local Servers:

- **Stdio transport** (standard input and output) used for locally running MCP servers, most server use this transport layer but its not a scalable or long term solution for corporations.

Remote Servers:

- **Streamable HTTP** uses HTTP POST & GET requests for client-to-server messages with optional Server-Sent Events for streaming capabilities, can be identified by `/mcp` endpoint.
- **SSE** (Server-Sent Events) this is a legacy transport layer servers using it will have a `/sse` endpoint.

#### 4. Authentication

Remote servers can handle multiple client connections, to identify users authentication can be implemented
bearer tokens, API keys, and custom headers. MCP recommends using OAuth to obtain authentication tokens.

To start tinkering I recommend using simple API keys passed as headers.

But for production the MCP specification suggests that clients and servers **should support** the OAuth 2.0 **Dynamic Client Registration (DCR)** Protocol RFC7591 to
allow MCP clients to obtain OAuth client IDs without user interaction [spec](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/authorization#dynamic-client-registration)
Which lets clients register with an OAuth 2.0 server automatically and get their own credentials, making it easier and more scalable to onboard new clients.

After DCR the authentication token is obtained through the OAuth 2.0 **Authorization Code** flow more on this in my [OAuth Compendium](https://matsjfunke.com/compendiums/oauth2).

#### Building an MCP server

To build an MCP server you won't have to write JSON-RPC methods, you can use one of the many SDKs for [TypeScript, Python, Rust, Go, Java, C#, Kotlin, Ruby, Swift and C#](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/sdk#sdks)
theres even one for [NextJS](https://github.com/vercel/mcp-adapter) by Vercel.
