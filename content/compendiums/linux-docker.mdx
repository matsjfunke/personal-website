## Option 1: Using apt-get

- Pros: Simple and quick installation with stable, well-tested versions.
- Cons: May not include the latest features and updates.

#### Step 1: Update and Upgrade Your System

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo reboot
```

#### Step 2: Install Docker and Docker Compose

```sh
sudo apt-get install -y docker.io docker-compose
```

**Note**: With the 'apt-get method', you might not get the latest features and fixes. Always check the versions installed and update if necessary.

## Option 2: Using the Docker Repository

- Pros: Provides access to the latest Docker features and updates with more version control.
- Cons: Involves more complex steps and may introduce newer, less tested features.

#### Step 1: Update and Upgrade Your System

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo reboot
```

#### Step 2: Install packages to allow apt to use repositories over HTTPS:

```sh
sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common -y
```

#### Step 3: Add Dockerâ€™s Official GPG Key

```sh
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
```

#### Step 4: Add the Docker repository to apt sources and update them:

```sh
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update
```

#### Step 5: Install Docker

```sh
sudo apt install docker-ce -y

# verify that Docker is installed and running correctly by running a test image:
sudo docker run hello-world
```

#### Step 6: Install Docker Compose

```sh
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

# verify with
docker-compose --version
```

#### Step 7: Manage Docker as a Non-root User

To avoid using sudo with Docker commands, create a Docker group and add your user:

```sh
sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
```

Log out and back in so that your group membership is re-evaluated.
