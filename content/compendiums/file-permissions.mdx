### Introduction

In Unix based Operating Systems, file and directory permissions are crucial for maintaining system security and ensuring that users have the appropriate access to resources. Permissions are divided into three categories: **owner**, **group**, and **others**. Each category can have different levels of access, defined by the ability to **read (`r`)**, **write (`w`)**, and **execute (`x`)**.

### Categories of Permissions

1. **Owner**: This is the user who owns the file or directory. The owner has specific permissions that can be different from the group and others.

2. **Group**: Unix based Operating Systems allow users to be grouped together. Permissions can be set so that all members of a group have the same access to a file or directory.

3. **Others**: This refers to all other users who are not the owner or part of the group. Permissions for others are usually the most restrictive.

### Types of Permissions

- **Read (`r`)**: Allows viewing the contents of a file or listing files within a directory.
- **Write (`w`)**: Allows modifying the contents of a file or adding/removing files within a directory.
- **Execute (`x`)**: For files, this allows running the file as a program. For directories, it allows accessing files within the directory.

### Symbols and and their meaning

- **Directories (d)**: Represented by a 'd' at the start of the permission string.
- **Files (-)**: Represented by a '-' at the start of the permission string.

For example, the permission string `-rwxr-xr--` can be broken down as follows:

- **File**: `-`
- **Owner**: `rwx` (read, write, execute)
- **Group**: `r-x` (read, execute)
- **Others**: `r--` (read only)

## Numeric Representation

In Unix based Operating Systems, file and directory permissions can also be represented numerically using a three-digit octal number. Each digit represents the permissions for the owner, group, and others, respectively. The permissions are calculated based on the sum of the following values:

- **Read**: (`r`) = 4
- **Write**: (`w`) = 2
- **Execute**: (`x`) = 1

Each permission set (owner, group, others) is represented by a digit ranging from 0 to 7. Here's how you calculate the value for each:

- 0 No permissions (`---`)
- 1 Execute only (`--x`)
- 2 Write only (`-w-`)
- 3 Write and execute (`-wx`)
- 4 Read only (`r--`)
- 5 Read and execute (`r-x`)
- 6 Read and write (Â´rw-`)
- 7 Read, write, and execute (`rwx`)

### Examples

**`644` (`rw-r--r--`)**:

- Owner: rw- (4 + 2 = 6)
- Group: r-- (4 = 4)
- Others: r-- (4 = 4)
  This means the owner can read and write, while the group and others can only read.

**755 (rwxr-xr-x)**:

- Owner: rwx (4 + 2 + 1 = 7)
- Group: r-x (4 + 1 = 5)
- Others: r-x (4 + 1 = 5)
  This means the owner can read, write, and execute, while the group and others can read and execute.

## Change Permissions

To change permissions, you use the `chmod` (change mode) or chown (change owner) command.

To change the permissions to `rwxrwxr-x` (`775`), you would use:

```bash
chmod 775 filename
```

This would set the permissions of your file to:

- Owner: `rwx (4 + 2 + 1 = 7)`
- Group: `rwx (4 + 2 + 1 = 7)`
- Others: `r-x (4 + 1 = 5)`

The chown command changes the ownership of a file or directory, allowing specification of a new owner and optionally a new group:

```bash
chown [new_owner][:new_group] [file/directory]
```

This would change the ownership of myfile.txt to newuser:

```bash
sudo chown newuser myfile.txt
```

This would change the ownership of myfile.txt to newuser and the group to newgroup:

```bash
sudo chown newuser:newgroup myfile.txt
```

This would change the ownership of mydirectory and all its contents (recursively) to newuser and newgroup.

```bash
sudo chown -R newuser:newgroup mydirectory
```
